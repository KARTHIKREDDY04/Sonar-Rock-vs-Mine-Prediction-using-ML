# Sonar Rock vs Mine Prediction

This project aims to predict whether an object detected by sonar is a rock or a mine using machine learning. The dataset used is the well-known **Sonar Dataset**, which contains data from sonar signals bounced off different objects. The classification task involves distinguishing rocks from metal cylinders (mines) using these signals.

## Project Overview

This project utilizes machine learning algorithms to classify sonar returns into two categories:
- Rock
- Mine (metal cylinder)

The primary goal is to build a model that can accurately classify new sonar signals as either representing a rock or a mine based on the provided features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project is the **Sonar Dataset**, available from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+%28sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks%29).

- **Number of instances**: 208
- **Number of attributes**: 60 (all continuous)
- **Attribute Information**: Each attribute represents energy at a particular frequency band, integrated over a certain period.
- **Classes**: 
  - `R`: Rock
  - `M`: Mine

### Example Data

| Feature 1 | Feature 2 | ... | Feature 60 | Label |
|-----------|-----------|-----|------------|-------|
| 0.02      | 0.03      | ... | 0.44       | R     |
| 0.03      | 0.07      | ... | 0.60       | M     |

## Usage

### 1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction.git
cd sonar-rock-vs-mine-prediction
```

### 2. Install dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Dataset
Ensure the dataset (`sonar.csv`) is available in the `data/` directory. If not, download it from [UCI](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/connectionist+bench+%28sonar,+mines+vs.+rocks%29) and place it in the `data` folder.

### 4. Run the model training script
You can train the model using the script in the `src` directory.

```bash
python src/model.py
```

## Model Training

We use different classification algorithms to train the model, including:
- **Logistic Regression**

The performance of these models is evaluated using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

### Preprocessing
- The features are standardized before training the model.
- We split the data into training and testing sets using an 80-20 split.

### Hyperparameter Tuning
- We use GridSearchCV to find the best hyperparameters for the KNN and SVM models.

## Results

After training the models, we achieved the following accuracy scores:

| Model                 | Accuracy |
|-----------------------|----------|
| Logistic Regression    | 83.2%    |

**Note**: You can view more detailed analysis and visualizations in the `sonar_analysis.ipynb` notebook.
